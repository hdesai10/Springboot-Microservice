?) What is SpringBoot?
   -what: Spring Boot is a framework for rapid application development build using spring framework
    with extra support of auto-configuration and embedded application server like tomcat. jetty.
   -Since it is stand alone, it is recommended for building Microservice.
   -How: It provides Rapid application development.
   -It heps us in creating efficient fast stand-alone applications which you can just run. it basically removes lot of configuration and dependencies.

?) why would you use Spring boot?
   -Easy to create stand alone, production grade application.
   -provides different starters templates for simplification of dependencies and build configuration.
   -Embedded server support
   -No requirement of XML based configuration like Web.xml, Spring.xml
   -Provide production ready features such as health-checks, information of application and other metrics also. (we need to add spring boot starter actuator dependencies to see that end point)

?) Any hands on Spring Boot?
   -Yes, I have worked on Spring boot. We have used Spring boot to create microservices. These microservice are rest Webservice.

?) Which version of Spring boot have you worked?
   -I have worked on Spring boot 2.0. It support minimum of java 1.8 and maven 3.3+ versions.

?) Do you know latest version of spring boot. ( need to work on this question)
   -current version of Spring boot is 2.2 and released on oct 17, 2019
   -Major changes


?) What is spring Initializer?
   -Spring Initialized is used to quickly create project structure. We need to add dependency, select build tool like either Maven or Gradle and then generate project structure.


?) What is spring boot-starter? what are the common starters you have used in your project?
  -Starter are templates provided by spring boot that provide dependencies to our application. They are generally bundle of many dependencies.
  -Spring-boot-starter-web, Spring-boot-starter-parent, Spring-boot-starter-jpa.

?) What is the default embedded server in Spring Boot, and it's default port and how to change server port.
   -Tomcat
   -default port for Tomcat server is 8080.
   -to change default server port. we need to change in application.properties (server.port : 8081)
   -we can also change default server port by using command line -Dserver.port = 8081

?) How to change default Tomcat embedded server?
  -Yes, we can change default embedded server. We need to remove dependency of Tomcat from spring-boot-starter-web using exclude tag
   and add dependency to pom.xml of any other server like undertow, Jetty, Netty.


?) I need to add some properties where can we add in spring boot?
   -application.properties file

?)Where do you deploy your spring boot application?
  -


?) How to deploy your spring boot application as Jar or War?
   -We used to deploying as Jar.

?) I need to generate war from spring boot app?
    - by default add <packaging/> as Jar. we just need to change to war.
    - Provide scope of tomcat as "provided"
    - Extended spring boot main application class with "SpringBoot servlet Initializer"
