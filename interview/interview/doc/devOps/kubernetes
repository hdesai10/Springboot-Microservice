?) What is kubernetes
    - Kubernetes is an open-source Container Management tool which automates container deployment, container scaling ,descaling, and container load balancing.
    - Kubernetes is written in Golang, and it has huge community because is was first developed by google and later  donated to CNCF.

    Nodes & Pods
    - A node can be Physical machine, virtual Machine, or VM on cloud.
    - Inside Nodes we have pods, there can be one or multiple pods in nodes.
    - And inside pods we have multiple containers. E.g. Docker containers

    Architecture ->
    - Master nodes -> worker nodes -> pods -> containers.
    - Master nodes manages both worker nods and pods

    In a Cluster Kubernetes supports:
    - No more than 5000 nodes
    - No more than 150000 total pods
    - No more than 300000 total containers
    - No more than 100 pods per node
